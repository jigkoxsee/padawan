# Primitive Datatypes and Operators

You have numbers, Math is what you would expect
```haskell
1 + 1 -- 2
8 - 1 -- 7
10 * 2 -- 20
35 / 5 -- 7.0
```

Boolean values are primitives
```haskell
-- Boolean operations
not True -- False
not False -- True
1 == 1 -- True
1 /= 1 -- False
1 < 10 -- True
```

---

## Strings and characters

```

"This is a string."
'a' -- character

-- Strings can be concatenated
"Hello " ++ "world!" -- "Hello world!"
```

## Lists

-- Every element in a list must have the same type.
-- These two lists are equal:

```haskell
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[1..5]

-- You can create a step in a range.
[0,2..10] -- [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
[5..1] -- [] (Haskell defaults to incrementing)
[5,4..1] -- [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

-- indexing into a list
[1..10] !! 3 -- 4 (zero-based indexing)
```

---


You can also have infinite lists in Haskell!

```haskell
[1..] -- a list of all the natural numbers
```

Infinite lists work because Haskell has *"lazy evaluation"*. This means
that Haskell only evaluates things when it needs to. So you can ask for
the 1000th element of your list and Haskell will give it to you:

```haskell
[1..] !! 999 -- 1000
```


```haskell
-- joining two lists
[1..5] ++ [6..10]

-- adding to the head of a list
0:[1..5] -- [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

-- more list operations
head [1..5] -- 1
tail [1..5] -- [2, 3, 4, 5]
init [1..5] -- [1, 2, 3, 4]
last [1..5] -- 5
```

---

```haskell
-- list comprehensions
[x*2 | x <- [1..5]] -- [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

-- with a conditional
[x*2 | x <- [1..5], x*2 > 4] -- [6, 8, 10]

```

---


## Tuple

Every element in a tuple can be a different type, but a tuple has a fixed length.

```haskell
("haskell", 1)

-- accessing elements of a pair (i.e. a tuple of length 2)
fst ("haskell", 1) -- "haskell"
snd ("haskell", 1) -- 1

-- pair element accessing does not work on n-tuples (i.e. triple, quadruple, etc)
snd ("snd", "can't touch this", "da na na na") -- error! see function below
```

---

# Functions

A simple function that takes two variables

```haskell
add a b = a + b
```

-- Note that if you are using ghci (the Haskell interpreter). You'll need to use `let`, i.e. `let add a b = a + b`

```haskell
-- Using the function
add 1 2 -- 3

-- You can also put the function name between the two arguments
-- with backticks:
1 `add` 2 -- 3

-- You can also define functions that have no letters! This lets
-- you define your own operators! Here's an operator that does
-- integer division
(//) a b = a `div` b
35 // 4 -- 8

```

---

## Guards

an easy way to do branching in functions

```haskell
fib x
  | x < 2 = 1
  | otherwise = fib (x - 1) + fib (x - 2)

```

Pattern matching is similar. Here we have given three different
equations that define fib. Haskell will automatically use the first
equation whose left hand side pattern matches the value.

```haskell
fib 1 = 1
fib 2 = 2
fib x = fib (x - 1) + fib (x - 2)
```

---

## Pattern matching
-- Pattern matching on tuples
```haskell
sndOfTriple (_, y, _) = y -- use a wild card (_) to bypass naming unused value
```

-- Pattern matching on lists. Here `x` is the first element
-- in the list, and `xs` is the rest of the list. We can write
-- our own map function:
```haskell
myMap func [] = []
myMap func (x:xs) = func x:(myMap func xs)
```

## Anonymous

Anonymous functions are created with a backslash followed by
all the arguments.

```haskell
myMap (\x -> x + 2) [1..5] -- [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

---

## Partial application

Partial application: if you don't pass in all the arguments to a function,
it gets "partially applied". That means it returns a function that takes the
rest of the arguments.

```haskell
add a b = a + b
foo = add 10 -- foo is now a function that takes a number and adds 10 to it
foo 5 -- 15
```

-- Another way to write the same thing
```haskell
foo = (10+)
foo 5 -- 15
```

---

## Function composition
the operator `.` chains functions together.
For example, here foo is a function that takes a value. It adds 10 to it,
multiplies the result of that by 4, and then returns the final value.

```haskell
foo = (4*) . (10+)

-- 4*(10+5) = 60
foo 5 -- 60
```

---

## Precedence

Haskell has an operator called `$`. This operator applies a function
to a given parameter. In contrast to standard function application, which
has highest possible priority of 10 and is left-associative, the `$` operator
has priority of 0 and is right-associative. Such a low priority means that
the expression on its right is applied as a parameter to the function on its left.

```haskell
-- before
even (fib 7) -- false

-- equivalently
even $ fib 7 -- false

-- composing functions
even . fib $ 7 -- false
```


---

# Type signatures

Haskell has a very strong type system, and every valid expression has a type.

Some basic types:
```haskell
5 :: Integer
"hello" :: String
True :: Bool
```

Functions have types too.
```haskell
-- `not` takes a boolean and returns a boolean:
-- not :: Bool -> Bool
```

-- Here's a function that takes two arguments:
```haskell
add :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
```

-- When you define a value, it's good practice to write its type above it:
```haskell
double :: Integer -> Integer
double x = x * 2
```

---

# Control Flow and If Expressions


if-expressions
```haskell
haskell = if 1 == 1 then "awesome" else "awful" -- haskell = "awesome"
```

if-expressions can be on multiple lines too, indentation is important
```haskell
haskell = if 1 == 1
            then "awesome"
            else "awful"
```

case expressions: Here's how you could parse command line arguments
```haskell
case args of
  "help" -> printHelp
  "start" -> startProgram
  _ -> putStrLn "bad args"
```

---

Haskell doesn't have loops; it uses recursion instead.
map applies a function over every element in a list

```haskell
map (*2) [1..5] -- [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

you can make a for function using map
```haskell
for array func = map func array
```

and then use it
```haskell
for [0..5] $ \i -> show i
```

we could've written that like this too:
```haskell
for [0..5] show
```

You can use foldl or foldr to reduce a list
foldl <fn> <initial value> <list>
```haskell
foldl (\x y -> 2*x + y) 4 [1,2,3] -- 43
```

```haskell
-- This is the same as
(2 * (2 * (2 * 4 + 1) + 2) + 3)
```

---

# Data Types


Here's how you make your own data type in Haskell

```haskell
data Color = Red | Blue | Green
```

 Now you can use it in a function:

```haskell
say :: Color -> String
say Red   = "You are Red!"
say Blue  = "You are Blue!"
say Green = "You are Green!"
```

Your data types can have parameters too:

```haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

These are all of type Maybe
```haskell
Just "hello"    -- of type `Maybe String`
Just 1          -- of type `Maybe Int`
Nothing         -- of type `Maybe a` for any `a`
```

---

# Haskell IO

While IO can't be explained fully without explaining monads,
it is not hard to explain enough to get going.

When a Haskell program is executed, `main` is
called. It must return a value of type `IO a` for some type `a`. For example:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn $ "Hello, sky! " ++ (say Blue)
-- putStrLn has type String -> IO ()
```

It is easiest to do IO if you can implement your program as
a function from String to String. The function
   interact :: (String -> String) -> IO ()
inputs some text, runs a function on it, and prints out the
output.

```haskell
countLines :: String -> String
countLines = show . length . lines

main' = interact countLines
```

---

You can think of a value of type `IO ()` as representing a
sequence of actions for the computer to do, much like a
computer program written in an imperative language. We can use
the `do` notation to chain actions together. For example:

The type `IO` is an example of a "monad". The way Haskell uses a monad to
do IO allows it to be a purely functional language. Any function that
interacts with the outside world (i.e. does IO) gets marked as `IO` in its
type signature. This lets us reason about which functions are "pure" (don't
interact with the outside world or modify state) and which functions aren't.

This is a powerful feature, because it's easy to run pure functions
concurrently; so, concurrency in Haskell is very easy.

# The Haskell REPL


Start the repl by typing `ghci`.
Now you can type in Haskell code. Any new values
need to be created with `let`:

```haskell
let foo = 5
```

You can see the type of any value or expression with `:t`:

```haskell
> :t foo
foo :: Integer

> :t (:)
(:) :: a -> [a] -> [a]
```

You can get additional information on any `name` using `:i`:

```haskell
> :i (+)
class Num a where
  (+) :: a -> a -> a
  ...
    -- Defined in ‘GHC.Num’
infixl 6 +
```
