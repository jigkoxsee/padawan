# K8S lOl

---

# ?
Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. It was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

# Why do I need k8s and what can it do

- Service discovery and load balancing
- Storage orchestration
- Automated rollouts and rollbacks
- Resource management and auto-scale
- Self-healing
- Secret and configuration management

# Components

## Master

Master components provide the cluster’s control plane. Master components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling), and they detect and respond to cluster events
- kube-apiserver
- etcd
- kube-scheduler
- kube-controller-manager


---
## Node

An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a pod.

The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy. The kubelet doesn’t manage containers which were not created by Kubernetes.

- kubelet
- kube-proxy
- container runtime -> docker, containerd, cri-o, rklet, ...

## Addons
- DNS, WebUI, Resource monitoring, Logging
